# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
def func(a,b):
  f = lambda a,b:a+b
  print(f)
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
func(a,b)
```

## Result
Thus the python program to get two values from user and return their sum using lambda function was created successfully.
